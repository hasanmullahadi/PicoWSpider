PicoWRobotV1.2

PicoW Robot V1.2 (Complete Kit)
Robotics Prototyping Board for Raspberry Pi Pico W - 4 DC Drivers, Gyro, PWM, USB-C Powered

Unlock the full potential of your Raspberry Pi Pico W with this versatile prototyping board designed specifically for fast, efficient robotics development. Perfect for hobbyists, students, and engineers, this board comes preloaded with advanced features to support even the most ambitious robotics projects.
Key Features of the PCB:
4 DC Motor Drivers (2 x TB6612FNG): Effortlessly control up to 4 DC motors, allowing for a wide range of motion control and driving mechanisms in your robotics projects, has a dedicated USB-C to be powered other than the PWM driver.
Built-in Gyroscope (MPU-6050): Track and manage orientation, acceleration, and motion data with the onboard 6-axis gyro and accelerometer—ideal for stabilizing and controlling robotic movements.
16-Channel PWM Driver (PCA9685PW): Control multiple servos or other PWM-driven components with precision using this powerful PWM driver, has a dedicated USB-C to be powered other than the Motor driver.
Dual USB-C Power Input: The board is equipped with an Ideal Diode (LM66200DRLR) for safely powering your motors and servo drivers via two separate USB-C sources. One USB-C port powers the motor drivers, and the other powers the PWM servo drivers, ensuring efficient and stable power distribution.
Common Anode RGB LED: Customizable LED for status indication or visual effects, perfect for enhancing your project’s interactivity.
4 Pushbutton Switches: Integrated tactile push buttons provide input and control options for real-time interaction with your robot.
OLED & Ultrasonic Sensor Headers: Pre-configured female headers for easy integration of OLED displays and ultrasonic sensors. Quickly add and test sensors with minimal setup.
HTD Female Header: Ready-to-use header for connecting additional sensors or components.
4 Expansion I2C Pin Headers: Expand your project by adding more I2C devices with the provided easy-access pin headers for quick integration.
Why Choose This Board?
Designed for Speed: Built specifically for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, this board enables fast prototyping for robotics projects, helping you save time and effort during development.
Flexible Powering Options: With dual USB-C power inputs, you can independently power your motors and servo drivers, giving you more control over power distribution and system stability.
Comprehensive Connectivity: With multiple expansion headers and built-in components, this board allows you to integrate a wide variety of sensors and peripherals without the need for additional wiring.
